### 📦 Concrete Artifacts to Deliver
- OpenAPI JSON export from `/api/schema/`
- Contract addresses and ABIs per chain
- Fully populated `.env.example`
- Test credentials document (users, JWTs, service tokens)
- Compliance API spec and JSON schema
- Settlement and webhook sample payloads
- Event definitions and sample logs
- (Optional) TypeScript helper snippets for frontend integration

---

### 🔜 Next Steps
- Replace placeholder contract addresses/ABIs with real ones and commit.
- Export live `/api/schema/` for canonical OpenAPI.
- Provision service account tokens and update env vars for each stage.
- Add SDK/helper snippets to DEX frontend or publish as a package.
- Use this table in GitHub issues/PRs to track progress.

👉 Arthur, this table format makes it easy to **track integration readiness at a glance**. Would you like me to also generate a **GitHub issue template** (Markdown with checkboxes) so your team can drop this straight into the repo and update statuses as they deliver?
